# Spaghetti Carbonara

## Summary
Spaghetti Carbonara is a classic Roman pasta dish made with eggs, cheese, pancetta, and black pepper. This creamy, indulgent recipe requires no cream and relies on the magic of emulsification to create its signature silky sauce.

## Ingredients
- 1 lb spaghetti
- 6 oz guanciale or pancetta, diced
- 4 large egg yolks
- 1 whole egg
- 1 cup Pecorino Romano cheese, finely grated
- 1/2 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, finely grated
- Freshly ground black pepper
- Salt for pasta water
- 1/2 cup pasta cooking water (reserved)

## Preparation
1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti according to package directions until al dente.
2. While pasta cooks, place diced guanciale in a cold skillet. Turn heat to medium and cook until fat renders and meat is crispy, about 8-10 minutes.
3. In a bowl, whisk together egg yolks, whole egg, Pecorino Romano, and Parmigiano-Reggiano. Add generous black pepper.
4. Reserve 1 cup of pasta cooking water, then drain pasta.
5. Remove skillet from heat and let cool for 1 minute.
6. Add hot pasta to the skillet with guanciale. Toss to coat in the fat.
7. Add egg mixture and quickly toss, adding pasta water a little at a time until sauce is creamy and coats the pasta.
8. Work quickly to avoid scrambling the eggs. The residual heat will cook them gently.
9. Season with more black pepper and serve immediately with extra grated cheese.
