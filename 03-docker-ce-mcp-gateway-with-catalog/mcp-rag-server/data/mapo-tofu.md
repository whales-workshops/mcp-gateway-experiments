# Mapo Tofu

## Summary
Mapo Tofu is a fiery Sichuan dish featuring silky tofu in a spicy, aromatic sauce with ground pork and fermented black beans. Known for its "málà" flavor (numbing and spicy), this iconic dish is comfort food at its finest.

## Ingredients
- 1 lb soft or silken tofu, cut into 1-inch cubes
- 1/2 lb ground pork
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 2 tablespoons Sichuan chili bean paste (doubanjiang)
- 2 tablespoons fermented black beans, rinsed and chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon fresh ginger, minced
- 1 tablespoon Sichuan peppercorns, toasted and ground
- 2 green onions, chopped (separate white and green parts)
- 1 cup chicken stock
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch mixed with 3 tablespoons water
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- Chili oil to taste

## Preparation
1. Bring a pot of water to a gentle boil. Add tofu cubes and simmer for 2 minutes to firm up. Drain carefully and set aside.
2. Heat vegetable oil in a wok over medium-high heat. Add ground pork and break up with a spatula. Cook until browned and crispy, about 5 minutes.
3. Push pork to the side. Add chili bean paste and fermented black beans to the center. Fry for 1 minute until fragrant and oil turns red.
4. Add garlic, ginger, and white parts of green onions. Stir-fry for 30 seconds.
5. Pour in chicken stock, soy sauce, and sugar. Bring to a simmer.
6. Gently slide tofu cubes into the sauce. Simmer for 3-4 minutes, occasionally spooning sauce over tofu. Be gentle to avoid breaking tofu.
7. Add cornstarch slurry gradually while gently stirring until sauce reaches desired thickness.
8. Sprinkle ground Sichuan peppercorns over the dish.
9. Drizzle with sesame oil and chili oil.
10. Garnish with green parts of green onions.
11. Serve hot over steamed rice.
