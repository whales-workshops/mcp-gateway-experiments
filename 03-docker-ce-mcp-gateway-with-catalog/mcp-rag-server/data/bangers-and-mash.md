# Bangers and Mash

## Summary
Bangers and Mash is a British pub classic featuring savory sausages served over creamy mashed potatoes with rich onion gravy. This comforting dish is simple, satisfying, and perfect for a cozy evening meal.

## Ingredients
**For the mash:**
- 3 lbs potatoes, peeled and cubed
- 4 tablespoons butter
- 1/2 cup whole milk, warmed
- Salt and white pepper to taste

**For the bangers:**
- 8 pork sausages (Cumberland or traditional British sausages)
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil

**For the onion gravy:**
- 2 large onions, thinly sliced
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 cups beef stock
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
- 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves
- 1 bay leaf
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Preparation
1. Place potatoes in a large pot of salted cold water. Bring to a boil and cook until tender, about 15-20 minutes.
2. While potatoes cook, start the gravy: Heat butter and oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
3. Add sliced onions and cook slowly, stirring occasionally, until caramelized and golden brown, about 25-30 minutes. Be patient for deep flavor.
4. Sprinkle flour over onions and stir for 2 minutes.
5. Gradually add beef stock, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Add Worcestershire sauce, balsamic vinegar, thyme, and bay leaf.
6. Simmer for 10-15 minutes until gravy thickens. Season with salt and pepper. Remove bay leaf. Keep warm.
7. For the sausages: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add sausages and cook, turning regularly, for 15-20 minutes until browned all over and cooked through.
8. Drain potatoes well and return to pot. Let steam for 1 minute to dry out.
9. Mash potatoes until smooth. Add butter and warm milk, mixing until creamy. Season with salt and white pepper.
10. Serve mashed potatoes topped with sausages and generously ladled with onion gravy.
11. Traditionally served with peas on the side.
