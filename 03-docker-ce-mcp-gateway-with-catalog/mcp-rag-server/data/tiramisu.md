# Tiramisu

## Summary
Tiramisu is Italy's most famous dessert, featuring layers of coffee-soaked ladyfinger cookies and a luscious mascarpone cream. This no-bake dessert means "pick me up" in Italian, referring to its energizing coffee flavor. Perfect make-ahead treat that gets better after chilling overnight.

## Ingredients
- 6 large egg yolks
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1 1/3 cups mascarpone cheese, room temperature
- 2 cups heavy cream, cold
- 2 cups strong espresso or coffee, cooled
- 1/4 cup coffee liqueur (Kahlúa or Marsala), optional
- 40-48 ladyfinger cookies (savoiardi)
- Unsweetened cocoa powder for dusting
- Dark chocolate shavings for garnish (optional)
- Pinch of salt

## Preparation
1. In a heatproof bowl, whisk egg yolks and sugar. Place over a pot of simmering water (double boiler).
2. Whisk constantly for 8-10 minutes until mixture is thick, pale, and reaches 160°F. Remove from heat.
3. Add mascarpone to the warm egg mixture and whisk until smooth. Let cool to room temperature.
4. In a separate bowl, whip heavy cream with a pinch of salt to stiff peaks.
5. Gently fold whipped cream into mascarpone mixture in three additions until fully combined and fluffy.
6. In a shallow dish, combine cooled espresso and coffee liqueur (if using).
7. Quickly dip each ladyfinger into the coffee mixture for 1-2 seconds per side. Don't oversoak or they'll be mushy.
8. Arrange a layer of soaked ladyfingers in the bottom of a 9x13 inch dish.
9. Spread half of the mascarpone cream over the ladyfingers, smoothing evenly.
10. Create a second layer of coffee-dipped ladyfingers.
11. Top with remaining mascarpone cream, spreading to the edges.
12. Cover and refrigerate for at least 6 hours, preferably overnight.
13. Before serving, generously dust with cocoa powder using a fine-mesh sieve. Add chocolate shavings if desired.
14. Cut into squares and serve chilled.
