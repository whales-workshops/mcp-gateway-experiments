## Ingredients
- 2 lbs center-cut beef tenderloin
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
- 8 oz pâté de foie gras or chicken liver pâté
- 1 lb mushrooms (cremini or button), finely chopped
- 2 shallots, minced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves
- 1/4 cup dry sherry or Madeira
- 8 slices prosciutto
- 1 lb puff pastry (store-bought or homemade)
- 2 egg yolks, beaten with 1 tablespoon water
- Flour for dusting

## Preparation
1. Season beef generously with salt and pepper. Heat olive oil in a skillet over high heat.
2. Sear beef on all sides until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate and brush with Dijon mustard. Let cool, then refrigerate for 30 minutes.
3. For the duxelles: Melt butter in a large pan over medium heat. Add shallots and garlic, cook for 2 minutes.
4. Add mushrooms and thyme. Cook, stirring frequently, until all liquid has evaporated and mixture is dry, about 15-20 minutes.
5. Add sherry and cook until evaporated. Season with salt and pepper. Let cool completely.
6. Lay a large piece of plastic wrap on counter. Arrange prosciutto slices in an overlapping rectangle.
7. Spread cooled mushroom duxelles evenly over prosciutto.
8. Spread pâté over the mushrooms.
9. Place chilled beef in center. Using plastic wrap, roll prosciutto and mushrooms tightly around beef. Twist ends to seal. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.
10. Roll out puff pastry on floured surface to a rectangle large enough to wrap beef completely.
11. Unwrap beef and place in center of pastry. Brush edges with egg wash.
12. Fold pastry over beef, trimming excess and sealing edges. Place seam-side down on a baking sheet.
13. Brush entire surface with egg wash. Score decorative patterns if desired. Chill for 30 minutes.
14. Preheat oven to 425°F.
15. Bake for 25-30 minutes until pastry is golden brown (internal temperature of 125°F for medium-rare).
16. Let rest for 10 minutes before slicing. Serve with red wine sauce or jus.
