**For the fish:**
- 4 cod or haddock fillets (6 oz each)

## Preparation
1. Cut potatoes into thick chips (1/2 inch thick). Soak in cold water for 30 minutes, then drain and pat very dry.
2. Heat oil to 325°F. Fry chips in batches for 5-6 minutes until soft but not colored. Drain on paper towels. Set aside.
3. For the batter: In a bowl, mix 1 cup flour, baking powder, salt, and pepper. Gradually whisk in cold beer until smooth. Refrigerate for 15 minutes.
4. Pat fish fillets completely dry with paper towels. Season with salt and pepper.
5. Place remaining 1/2 cup flour in a shallow dish. Dredge each fillet in flour, shaking off excess.
6. Increase oil temperature to 375°F.
7. Dip each floured fillet into batter, letting excess drip off.
8. Carefully lower fish into hot oil. Fry for 5-7 minutes until golden brown and crispy, turning once. Drain on paper towels.
9. Return chips to oil and fry at 375°F for 2-3 minutes until golden and crispy. Drain and season with salt.
10. For mushy peas: Cook peas in boiling salted water for 3 minutes. Drain and mash with butter, salt, pepper, and mint if using.
11. Serve fish and chips immediately with mushy peas, tartar sauce, lemon wedges, and malt vinegar.
