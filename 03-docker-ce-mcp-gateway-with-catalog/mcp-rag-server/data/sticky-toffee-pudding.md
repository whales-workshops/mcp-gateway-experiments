## Preparation
1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter and flour a 9x9 inch baking pan.
2. Place chopped dates in a bowl. Pour boiling water over dates and stir in baking soda. Let soak for 15 minutes until softened.
3. In a large bowl, cream butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.
4. Beat in eggs one at a time, then add vanilla extract.
5. In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt.
6. Mash the date mixture with a fork (some chunks are fine).
7. Add flour mixture to butter mixture in three additions, alternating with date mixture, beginning and ending with flour.
8. Pour batter into prepared pan and smooth the top.
9. Bake for 35-40 minutes until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean.
10. While pudding bakes, make toffee sauce: Combine cream, butter, brown sugar, and golden syrup in a saucepan.
11. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes until thickened.
12. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla and salt.
13. When pudding is done, poke holes all over with a skewer while still warm.
14. Pour half the toffee sauce over the warm pudding, letting it soak in.
15. Cut into squares and serve warm with additional toffee sauce and vanilla ice cream or clotted cream.
16. Store leftover pudding covered in refrigerator. Reheat individual portions in microwave before serving.
