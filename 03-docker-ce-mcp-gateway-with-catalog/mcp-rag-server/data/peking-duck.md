# Peking Duck

## Summary
Peking Duck is an iconic Chinese dish from Beijing, famous for its crispy skin and tender meat. Traditionally served with thin pancakes, scallions, cucumber, and hoisin sauce, this impressive dish requires time and technique but delivers spectacular results.

## Ingredients
**For the duck:**
- 1 whole duck (5-6 lbs)
- 6 cups water
- 1/4 cup maltose or honey
- 2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 3 slices fresh ginger
- 3 star anise
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 2 green onions

**For serving:**
- 24 Mandarin pancakes (store-bought or homemade)
- 1/2 cup hoisin sauce
- 1 cucumber, julienned into matchsticks
- 8 green onions, cut into 3-inch strips and julienned

## Preparation
1. Clean duck thoroughly, remove excess fat. Pat completely dry inside and out.
2. Bring 6 cups water to boil with maltose, wine, ginger, star anise, and cinnamon.
3. Hold duck over sink and ladle boiling mixture over entire surface 4-5 times. This tightens the skin.
4. Pat duck dry again. Rub salt inside cavity. Place ginger slices and green onions inside.
5. Place duck on a rack in a roasting pan. Let air-dry uncovered in refrigerator for 24 hours (or 8 hours minimum). This step is crucial for crispy skin.
6. Remove duck from refrigerator 1 hour before cooking to bring to room temperature.
7. Preheat oven to 375°F. Fill roasting pan with 1 inch of water (keeps oven moist).
8. Roast duck breast-side up for 30 minutes.
9. Flip duck breast-side down, roast for 30 minutes.
10. Flip back breast-side up, increase temperature to 425°F, roast for 15-20 minutes until skin is deep mahogany brown and crispy.
11. Let rest for 10 minutes before carving.
12. Slice duck meat and crispy skin into thin pieces.
13. Warm pancakes by steaming for 2-3 minutes.
14. To serve: Spread hoisin sauce on pancake, add duck skin and meat, cucumber, and green onion. Roll and enjoy.
