# Osso Buco

## Summary
Osso Buco is a Milanese specialty featuring braised veal shanks in a rich wine and tomato sauce. The name means "bone with a hole," referring to the marrow-filled bone in the center. Traditionally topped with gremolata, this dish is the epitome of Italian comfort food.

## Ingredients
- 4 veal shanks (about 1.5 inches thick)
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 onion, diced
- 2 carrots, diced
- 2 celery stalks, diced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup dry white wine
- 1 cup beef or veal stock
- 28 oz can crushed tomatoes
- 2 bay leaves
- 3 sprigs fresh thyme
- Salt and pepper to taste

**For the gremolata:**
- Zest of 1 lemon
- 1/4 cup fresh parsley, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced

## Preparation
1. Preheat oven to 325°F. Tie each veal shank with kitchen twine to hold shape. Season with salt and pepper.
2. Dredge shanks in flour, shaking off excess.
3. Heat oil and butter in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Brown veal shanks on all sides, about 3-4 minutes per side. Remove and set aside.
4. Reduce heat to medium. Add onion, carrots, and celery. Cook until softened, about 8 minutes.
5. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.
6. Pour in white wine, scraping up browned bits. Let reduce by half, about 5 minutes.
7. Add stock, crushed tomatoes, bay leaves, and thyme. Stir to combine.
8. Return veal shanks to pot, nestling them into the sauce. Liquid should come halfway up the shanks.
9. Cover and transfer to oven. Braise for 2 to 2.5 hours until meat is very tender and falling off the bone.
10. Turn shanks once halfway through cooking.
11. For gremolata: Mix lemon zest, parsley, and garlic in a small bowl.
12. Remove bay leaves and thyme sprigs. Serve osso buco with sauce spooned over, topped with gremolata. Excellent with risotto or polenta.
