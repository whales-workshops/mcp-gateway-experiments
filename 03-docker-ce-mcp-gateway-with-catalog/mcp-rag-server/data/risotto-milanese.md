# Risotto alla Milanese

## Summary
Risotto alla Milanese is a luxurious northern Italian rice dish flavored with saffron, giving it a distinctive golden color and subtle floral taste. This creamy, elegant risotto is traditionally served alongside Osso Buco but is delicious on its own.

## Ingredients
- 1 1/2 cups Arborio or Carnaroli rice
- 6 cups chicken or vegetable stock, kept hot
- 1 cup dry white wine
- Large pinch of saffron threads (about 1/2 teaspoon)
- 1 small onion, finely diced
- 3 tablespoons butter, divided
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, grated
- Salt and white pepper to taste
- Fresh parsley for garnish

## Preparation
1. Warm 1/4 cup of hot stock and add saffron threads. Let steep for 10 minutes.
2. Heat olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat.
3. Add diced onion and cook until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Do not brown.
4. Add rice and stir for 2-3 minutes until grains are coated and slightly translucent at the edges.
5. Pour in white wine and stir until completely absorbed.
6. Add saffron-infused stock, stirring until absorbed.
7. Begin adding hot stock one ladle at a time, stirring constantly. Wait until liquid is almost completely absorbed before adding more.
8. Continue this process for 18-20 minutes until rice is creamy and al dente.
9. Remove from heat. Stir in remaining butter and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese vigorously to create a creamy consistency (mantecatura).
10. Season with salt and white pepper. Let rest covered for 2 minutes.
11. Serve immediately, garnished with fresh parsley and extra cheese.
